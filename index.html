        <h2>The story you never knew...</h2>
        <p>After ten years of serving the gods, 
           Kratos is ordered to kill his former 
           master, Ares, the God of War (this is where 
           the name of the game comes from). 
           This involves opening Pandora's Box, 
           taking its power, and laying the foundations 
           for later betrayals. </p>
